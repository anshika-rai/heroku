                    <h1>Learn by Earn Scheme</h1>
                    <p>
                        'Learn by Earn Scheme' facilitates financially poor students so as to they can
                        pursue higher education. This scheme is basically undertaken for the benefit
                        of students those who are needy, economically backward, intelligent and
                        meritorious but cannot afford higher education. Under this scheme, a student
                        who wishes to earn along with their studies could work for 4 hours a day in
                        the school. The students enrolled under the scheme are assigned various
                        technical works such as lab maintenance, database administration, computer
                        network management, library assistance, and teaching assistant etc.
                        consequently, students gain experience and thereby they are prepared
                        themselves better for taking up jobs in future. It is also helpful for
                        preventing candidates from distractions and engage them in meaningful and
                        positive activities. This scheme enables meritorious and needy students to
                        earn a reasonable amount every month to meet their expenses.
