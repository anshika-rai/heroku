                    <p> The institute is running computer applications, computer science, and information technology
                        courses. The assessment practices are used to analyze the results to arrive at possible changes
                        in the programs to improve achievement of the outcomes in teaching learning. Following are the

                        courses. helped to change credits of course especially in practical subjects; new projects were
                        assigned in few courses; more laboratory assignment given; major emphasis is given on placement;
                        Students are happy that they were given an opportunity to voice their views without any fear and
                        prejudice; more elective subjects introduced; more facilities provided for hospitality at
                        campus, hostel, lab resources etc; the overall sense of belonging to the institute among the
                        students and the teachers strengthened; teaching strategy will be improved that can help in
