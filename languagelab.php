                    <p>
                        The language laboratory established in the year 2011 at School of Computer
                        Science & IT, with UGC support and is used by all University Teaching
                        Department (UTD) students. The main objective is to enhance students' language
                        skills, communication skills, vocabulary, listening skills and pronunciation
                        accuracy. Language Lab is a fully computerized client server application. It
                        has an easy to use console displayed on the desktop of the server to
                        facilitate the faculty to conduct the course. Students access the courseware
                        through client systems.
